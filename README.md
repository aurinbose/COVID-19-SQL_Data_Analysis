# COVID-19-SQL_Data_Analysis

This project is a data analysis of Covid-19 deaths and vaccination data from 03/01/2020 to 04/05/2023, using SQL. The main chunk of the project was completed using BigQuery to run SQL statements and then Tableau was used to create vivid dashboards for visualization. 

The dataset used was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and project outline is as done in Alex the Analyst's Data Analyst Portfolio Project Parts 1 and 2 which are featured on his Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst. Highly recommend giving the channel a subscribe especially if you are an aspiring Data Analyst like me.
